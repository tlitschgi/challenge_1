Horiseon Website
Update Horiseon Marketing Website to follow accessibility standards.  Also, refactor the code with more HTML semantics as well as clean up the HTML structure.
This allows people with disabilities access the website. Also, by improving the codebase, it is easier to read, therefore, easier to maintain.
Lesson learned...when refactoring code, be sure to test all functionalities to verify nothing else is broken as a result of your change.
